1.	Prepare the dataset and look at data 
a.	Rename the files to make analysis easier.  

A = TB-T2D coinfected individuals (35 in total)
B = TB-only individuals (11 in total)
C = T2D-only (33 in total)
D = healthy individuals (24 in total)

E = Diagnosis 
F = Week2 
G = Month2
H = Month6

**NOTE: Samples were not all sequenced on the same sequencer, run or lanes. This could bring in bias in differential gene expression. Need to correct for noise in statistical models. 

One individual however is sequenced on the same sequencer and run, but on different flow cell lanes. Just need to account for this in statistical analysis.
